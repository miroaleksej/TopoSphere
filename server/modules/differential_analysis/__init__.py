TopoSphere Differential Analysis Module

This module provides the Differential Analysis component for the TopoSphere system, implementing the
industrial-grade standards of AuditCore v3.2. The Differential Analysis is a critical component designed
to detect subtle vulnerabilities through comparative topological analysis of ECDSA implementations.

The module is based on the following key mathematical principles from our research:
- For secure ECDSA implementations, the signature space forms a topological torus (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1)
- For any public key Q = dG and for any pair (u_r, u_z) ∈ ℤ_n × ℤ_n, there exists a signature (r, s, z)
- Diagonal symmetry r(u_r, u_z) = r(u_z, u_r) must hold for secure implementations
- Differential analysis compares implementations to detect subtle deviations from expected patterns

As stated in our research: "Topology is not a hacking tool, but a microscope for diagnosing vulnerabilities.
Ignoring it means building cryptography on sand." This module embodies that principle by providing
mathematically rigorous comparative analysis that detects vulnerabilities while maintaining privacy
guarantees.

Key features:
- Comparative analysis of target implementation against reference implementations
- Topological distance calculation for vulnerability detection
- Anomaly pattern detection through deviation analysis
- Integration with TCON (Topological Conformance) verification engine
- Fixed resource profile enforcement to prevent timing/volume analysis
- Differential privacy mechanisms to prevent algorithm recovery
- Multiscale Nerve Analysis for vulnerability detection across different scales

This implementation follows the industrial-grade standards of AuditCore v3.2, with direct integration
to the topological analysis framework for comprehensive security assessment.
