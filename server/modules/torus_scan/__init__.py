TopoSphere Torus Scan Module

This module provides the Torus Scan component for the TopoSphere system, implementing the
industrial-grade standards of AuditCore v3.2. The Torus Scan is a critical component designed
to detect vulnerabilities in ECDSA implementations through analysis of the spiral structure on
the torus.

The module is based on the following key mathematical principles from our research:
- For secure ECDSA implementations, the signature space forms a topological torus (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1)
- For any public key Q = dG and for any pair (u_r, u_z) ∈ ℤ_n × ℤ_n, there exists a signature (r, s, z)
- Diagonal symmetry r(u_r, u_z) = r(u_z, u_r) must hold for secure implementations
- Spiral structure k = u_z + u_r·d mod n provides critical security insights

As stated in our research: "On the torus, the curve k = d · u_r + u_z forms a spiral ('snail')"
and "Topology is not a hacking tool, but a microscope for diagnosing vulnerabilities. Ignoring
it means building cryptography on sand." This module embodies that principle by providing
mathematically rigorous security guarantees that protect intellectual property while maintaining
security.

Key features:
- Spiral pattern analysis for vulnerability detection based on k = u_z + u_r·d mod n
- Adaptive scanning with Quantum-Inspired Amplitude Amplification
- Torus Vulnerability Mapper (TVM) for precise vulnerability localization
- Integration with TCON (Topological Conformance) verification engine
- Fixed resource profile enforcement to prevent timing/volume analysis
- Differential privacy mechanisms to prevent algorithm recovery
- Multiscale Nerve Analysis for vulnerability detection across different scales

This implementation follows the industrial-grade standards of AuditCore v3.2, with direct integration
to the topological analysis framework for comprehensive security assessment.
