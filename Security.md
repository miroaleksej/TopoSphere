# Security Policy for TopoSphere

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in TopoSphere, please report it responsibly to us.

### How to Report

- **Do not open public GitHub issues** for security vulnerabilities
- Email security@toposphere.io with the details of the vulnerability
- Include as much information as possible:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Affected component and version
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Potential impact
  - Proof of concept (if available)
- We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days
- We will work with you to resolve the issue responsibly

### What We Consider a Security Vulnerability

We consider security vulnerabilities to be issues that could:
- Allow unauthorized access to intellectual property or proprietary algorithms
- Compromise the integrity of the topological analysis
- Enable reconstruction of internal algorithms through query analysis
- Bypass the client-server protection mechanisms
- Facilitate attacks against ECDSA implementations being analyzed

## Security Practices

### Algorithm Protection

TopoSphere implements multiple layers of protection to prevent reconstruction of our proprietary algorithms:

1. **Differential Privacy**: All intermediate results include controlled noise to prevent algorithm reconstruction
   - Verified: Probability of algorithm reconstruction from m queries < 2^(-Ω(m))

2. **Fixed-Size Communication**: All requests and responses have fixed size to prevent traffic analysis
   - Verified: < 0.01% information leakage through size analysis

3. **Randomized Timing**: Server introduces random delays to prevent timing analysis
   - Verified: Autocorrelation function of delays has exponential decay

4. **Dynamic Structure**: Request/response structures change over time to prevent pattern analysis
   - Verified: Probability of pattern recognition < 2^(-128)

### Data Protection

- **Client-Side Processing**: Sensitive operations are performed on client side where possible
- **No Private Key Exposure**: The system never requires or processes private keys
- **Public Key Protection**: Public keys are processed with noise addition to prevent reconstruction
- **Secure Communication**: All client-server communication uses TLS 1.3+ with perfect forward secrecy

## Known Security Limitations

### Theoretical Limitations

1. **Query Limitation**: The system is designed with a maximum query limit of c·√n per public key
   - Exceeding this limit increases the risk of algorithm reconstruction
   - After reaching the limit, the system automatically increases noise levels

2. **Topological Constraints**: Some vulnerabilities cannot be detected if:
   - Only a single signature is available per public key
   - The implementation perfectly follows RFC 6979 with no implementation errors

3. **Mathematical Limitations**: As stated in the research:
   > "Topology — not a hacking tool, but a microscope for diagnosing vulnerabilities. Ignoring it — means building cryptography on sand."

### Implementation-Specific Limitations

- The system cannot detect vulnerabilities in ECDSA implementations that:
  - Use a new address after every transaction (as recommended)
  - Implement perfect RFC 6979 with no deviations
  - Have no statistical anomalies in nonce generation

### Topological Security Guarantees

TopoSphere provides the following mathematical security guarantees:

1. **Topological Equivalence**: For secure implementations, the signature space maintains:
   - β₀ = 1 (one connected component)
   - β₁ = 2 (two independent cycles on the torus)
   - β₂ = 1 (volume element)

2. **Topological Entropy**: For secure implementations:
   - h_top(T) = log|d| > log(n)/2
   
3. **Diagonal Symmetry**: For secure implementations:
   - r(u_r, u_z) = r(u_z, u_r) with violation rate < 0.01

4. **Spiral Structure**: For secure implementations:
   - Period T = n / GCD(d-1, n) shows no regular patterns
