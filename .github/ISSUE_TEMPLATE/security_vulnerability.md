## Security Policy Reminder

As stated in our research: "Topology is not a hacking tool, but a microscope for diagnosing vulnerabilities. Ignoring it means building cryptography on sand."

For secure ECDSA implementations, the signature space forms a topological torus (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1). Any deviation from this topological structure indicates potential vulnerabilities that could lead to private key recovery.

The TopoSphere security team will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. Provide a timeline for investigation and resolution
3. Keep you informed about the progress
4. Credit you for your contribution (if you wish)

**DO NOT**:
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it's resolved
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Perform automated scanning or testing that could disrupt service

Thank you for helping make TopoSphere more secure!
